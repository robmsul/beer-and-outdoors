    <h2>Craft beer and skiing: the perfect combo</h2>

  <p>Last December, I found myself in one of the best ski states, CO, during one of the <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2018/01/06/colorado-snowpack-levels-january-2018/" target="_blank">worst times</a>. At Breckenridge Ski Resort, 10% of the mountain was open during my mid-December ski vacation. However, I did not let this ruin my first trip “out west.” My family and I took advantage of a beautiful ski village and, as I would come to find, fantastic beer scene.</p>
  <p>After skiing each day we ventured into town to sip on suds from Breckenridge Brewery and Broken Compass Brewing, both in Breck. At brewpubs, I found a wide selection of more tasty beverages from across the state. It quickly came to my attention that CO is full of breweries.</p>
  <p>This didn’t necessarily surprise me, but I never gave beer beyond my state much thought prior to the trip. Being from Asheville, NC (and having only recently become of age), my beer world was small. This got me wondering about all the states.</p>


  <div id="map-states"></div>

  <p>At a quick glance, California and Colorado stand out, along with Washington, and New York. This list brings to mind Lake Tahoe, Telluride, Mt. Baker, and Whiteface: all places well-known for their top-notch skiing. </p>
  <p>After stumbling into a beer-lover’s paradise at Breck, I wondered, “Is there a connection between beer and skiing?” There certainly are cultural associations with malt beverages and many outdoor sports.</p>
  <p>Biking, paddling, climbing, and camping all have cultures that respect a good brew, but skiing and beer have a unique history thanks to the French tradition of après-ski. For those unaware, “après-ski” is the term for social activities at the ski lodge after a day of skiing. According to <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/apr%C3%A8s-ski" target="_blank">Merriam Webster</a> the term was first used in 1951 and comes from the French après (after) + ski (you got this one). The French tradition has been adapted by skiers all over the world and holds a prominent place in American ski culture – although the Europeans might be <a href="https://youtu.be/WKV3Xtti-Sk?t=135" target="_blank">a little crazier</a>. </p>
  <p>We know the craft brewery numbers, but what about the skiing? Rather than simply relying on our preconceptions about US skiing, let’s take a look at the number of ski areas in each state. This chart provides the number of all states with over 10 ski areas as of 2017.</p>
